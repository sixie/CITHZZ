1) In a CMSSW release download the MLFit:

cvs co -d MLFit UserCode/mpierini/MLFit
cd MLFit 
make -f Makefile_CMS

in this way a shared library will be created: workdir/libMLFit.so.
This will have to be loaded in ROOT before doing fits etc.

2) setup the code to do the fit to your fit variable.
For example, for the Z->ee fits to make sPlots of ele ID variables:

cvs co -d LeptonSPlots UserCode/CITHZZ/LeptonScaleAndResolution/LeptonSPlots

3) Make the fit, and compute the sWeights. 
For example with this macro, after loading RooLogon.C to setup libraries, etc.


root -l RooLogon.C
.L src/FitZElectronsData.cc
FitZElectrons(0,0)
PlotZElectrons(0,0)
calcSWeight(0,0)

(where 0,0 are the pt,eta bins in this example, see the automated script:
runfits.py)

this will create a ROOT file with the original variables in the tree
with additional variables that are for the signal and background sweights

4) do the plots for the NOT-fit variables to which you are interested 
(eg. eleID variables) and compare with your simulation models, reading the 
data tree with sPlots:
Eg.: src/makeSPlots.cc
