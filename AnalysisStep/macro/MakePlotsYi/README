Right now it's not very user friendly.  To run the program, first link the root files here:

ln -s /path/to/7TeV/MC/root/files 7TeV
ln -s /path/to/8TeV/MC/root/files 8TeV
ln -s /path/to/7TeV/Data/root/file hcp7.root
ln -s /path/to/8TeV/Data/root/file hcp8.root

Then compile and run stuff:

sh compile.sh
sh BasicRunAll.sh
cd Plotting
./Run

During the first step, a bunch a histograms will be produced for each file,
which are then combined and copied into the plotting directory, where
we combine things and make the final plots.
